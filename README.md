Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is systematic application of engineering principle,methods and tools in the development and maintenace of high quality software systems and its importance in the technology industry is to create softwares and systems that powers various aspect of modern life such as communication,commerce and health care

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages such as Fortran and C
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline
Advent of structured programming in the 1970s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement - Gatering and documenting user needs and system requirement
Design - creating detailed design of the software architecture interface
Implementation - writing code to build software according to design specification
Testing - Conduct test to ensure the software meet quality standard and functional requirements
Deployment - Releasing the software to users
Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, update and enhancement of software capabilities after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology has sequential approach with distinct phases such as requirement, design and implementation while while agile methodology has iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer - writing code and implementing software solution
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensure software quality by designing and executing test plan
Project manager - oversee the planning, execution, delivery of software project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - They help in writing code,debugging and testing code e.g visual studio
VCS - They help in tracking changes in software source code and coordinating work among team members e.g GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing  requirements - can be overcomed by doing thorough research so as to be able to come up with necessary requirement so as to even when the changes come they will be minimal
Technical Debt - can be solved by ensuring software engineers follow strictly the laid out project plan without shortcut so as to prevent software misfunction which may increase maintenance cost

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing - testing individual componet or module of software and it helps in preventing error at a module level
Intergration tesing - testing interaction between components or subsystem and it helps in preventing errors while doing intergration
System testing - Testing entire software and it helps in preventing error during software functioning
Acceptance testing - testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user need and it helps users in giving feedback after interacting with the softaware

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions to get best possible responses from AI model and its important by helping avoid avoid that by making questions more clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what we need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt - Tell me about software engineer
Clear prompt - Tell me evolution of softawre engineer and why it is important in the technology industry
The clear prompt is much effective since keywords that guide the AI toward the kind of response the user wants
